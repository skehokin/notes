<p>"this" is a keyword in JavaScript which refers to the object initiating a function.</p>

<h3>An easy way to figure "this" out</h3>

<p>
	"this", when used as a keyword in a function, is bound to the object initiating that function. So, when you call <i>myObject.func</i>, "this" refers to the object before the dot.
</p>

<p>To explain:</p>

<p>
	When you call a function, often that function will be a property (or "method") of an object. (These can be either built into the datatype or added by an API, library or yourself).
</p>
<p>
	For instance when you call:
	<pre>document.getElementById("main-heading").setAttribute("class", "capslock");</pre>
	setAttribute is a method of Elements, from which the "main-heading" HTML element inherits, and hence a method of "main-heading" itself.
</p>
<p>
 	So, that's a method.
</p>
<p>
	In the above example, if the "this" keyword was used in the setAttribute() function, then what would "this" refer to?
</p>
<p>
	Answer: "this" would refer to the HTML element with the id of "main-heading", because "this" refers back to the object that is initiating the function. Meaning, it refers to whatever is written before the dot:
	<pre>document.getElementById("main-heading")</pre>
</p>

<h3>What if it's not a method? What if there's nothing before the dot?</h3>
<p>If the function is defined in the global scope and therefore outside of any function, then "this" is bound to the global object(!)</p>
