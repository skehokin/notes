<p>Classes are the primary object oriented programming feature. Here's how they can be implemented in JavaScript.</p>

<h3>
What are classes?
</h3>
<p>
Outside of JavaScript, classes are often an inbuilt part of a programming language. They are used to create a multitude of objects on the same pattern, which can all do the same things. A common analogy is that a class is like a blueprint to build an object.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript doesn't have inbuilt classes, but OOP-style programming can still be done by making your own classes, implemented through a variety of methods. These create new objects and give them properties. The functions used to so are called "constructors"

	<h3>How do you build a class?</h3>
	<p>
		classes are created in a very similar way to <a href="javascript_patterns.html#object-decorators">object decorators</a>, except that instead of adding properties to an already existing object, constructors create a whole new object. Conventionally, a class is named with a capitalised noun.
